a simple script for me to format bile json files into markdown

## Installation

You need to copy your bible json files into the `bible/` folder. This folder must contain 1 json file per bible book + an index.json.

You can check if you have setup correctly by counting, there should be 67 json files, because there are 66 bible books.

A good way to gain these json files is by using a tool like [this](https://github.com/oldmartijntje/BibleDownloader).

Keep in mind that you are only allowed to download information that you already own. Piracy is not allowed.

## Customization

You can convert your bible.json into your personalised markdown format.
