I will not promise to add the below items, but this is more of a mental note for me not to forget about these ideas / things.

- [ ] Add support for cross references import. [This website](https://www.openbible.info/labs/cross-references/) already has that data. And [this obsidian user](https://github.com/JackNathan05/Obsidian-Bible-KJV/blob/main/organized_bible/01%3A%20Genesis/Genesis%20ch%3A%2045.md) also added that to their vault.
- [ ] Look int this [obsidian forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/bible-study-in-obsidian-kit-including-the-bible-in-markdown/12503) about bible zettelkasten.
- [ ] Look into what [this user](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1rdd7fr/comment/o74t29a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) said on reddit
- [ ] Add support in the downloading tool for more bibles, more sources etc
- [ ] Add more paramaters that you cna put into your JSON that will work with the templates
